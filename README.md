<h1> Just a Small test for you, bro! </h1>

Remember to download the roslibjs and ros3djs from the original repo (and put them in js folder)!

<h3>roslib:</h3>
https://github.com/RobotWebTools/roslibjs


<h3>ros3djs:</h3>
https://github.com/RobotWebTools/ros3djs

you have to run the following nodes also:

<ul>
  <li>roslaunch rosbridge_server rosbridge_websocket.launch</li>
  <li>rosrun tf2_web_republisher tf2_web_republisher</li>
</ul>

And remember to put the example in a server like Apache2!
